# EAI 2026 - Session 0 environment doctor (PowerShell).

# Seven checks. Every failure names what is wrong and what to do about it.
# The last line is always "DOCTOR: PASS" or "DOCTOR: FAIL (n checks)".
# Exit code is 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.
#
# Targets Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what ships with Windows - so no
# ternary operator, no ?? and no -AsHashtable in here. Deliberately ASCII
# only: PS 5.1 reads .ps1 files as ANSI unless they carry a BOM, and a stray
# accented character turns into mojibake on somebody's machine.
#
# Its output is kept identical to doctor.sh - if you change one, change both.
#
#   Run it with:  .\doctor.ps1
#   If Windows refuses to run the script, see README.md (execution policy).
